# Object Detection with OpenCV and EasyGUI

This project demonstrates object detection using OpenCV and EasyGUI. It uses a pre-trained model to detect objects in an image and displays the results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
- [EasyGUI](https://pypi.org/project/easygui/)

Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv-python-headless
pip install easygui
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnayaChoudhari/Object-Detection.git
cd Object-Detector
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

1. Execute the script.
2. Select an image using the EasyGUI file dialog.
3. The script will display the selected image with bounding boxes and labels around detected objects.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/improvement`)
3. Make changes and commit (`git commit -am 'Add feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/improvement`)
5. Create a pull request

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
